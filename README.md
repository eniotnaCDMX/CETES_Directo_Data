# CETES_Directo_Data

This repository contains CSV files representing the weekly evolution of the interest rate of Mexican governmental financial products, such as CETES, BONDDIA, etc ... The values can be downloaded at the url : https://www.banxico.org.mx/SieInternet/consultarDirectorioInternetAction.do?accion=consultarCuadro&idCuadro=CF107&sector=22&locale=es.

However, the data contained here are cleaned so they can be dowload as a DataFrame very easily. They are also updated (much quicker than the Mexican central bank does) from web scraping (data come from this url : https://www.cetesdirecto.com/tablas/valores_gubernamentales/cetes.html) each tuesday morning.
